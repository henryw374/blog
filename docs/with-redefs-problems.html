  When to avoid with-redefs
  
</h1>
<p><a href='https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/with-redefs'>with-redefs</a> is a handy clojure.core function to use when you want to redefine one or more vars temporarily (within a block) and you want these redefinitions to apply across thread boundaries</p><p>An alternative for doing something similar is <a href='https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/with-bindings'>with-bindings</a>, and that is slightly different in that the new bindings are only seen within the context of the current thread. If for example, you use with-bindings on a var and the value of the var is referenced when doing a <code>clojure.core/map</code> operation say, then it is possible you won't see the temp binding, since <code>map</code> is lazy and may be executed in a different thread.</p><p>Also, <code>with-bindings</code> requires the rebound vars are dynamic. </p><p>So... with-redefs is generally a more powerful go-to tool than with-bindings?</p><p>No, <code>with-bindings</code> is more generally used on vars that are planned to get rebound, whereas <code>with-redefs</code> is intended when you want to change the way things normally work, for example when you're running a test and decide you don't really want to call an external system, and can use with-redefs to stub.</p><p>However, beware that <code>with-redefs</code> is not foolproof. Consider rebinding a function foo</p><pre><code>&#40;with-redefs &#91;a.b.c/foo my-temp-fn&#93;
  ... body that calls foo at some point, possibly from another thread&#41;
</code></pre><p>Will the body here always see your temp binding?</p><p><strong>No</strong></p><p>Why not?</p><p>Well, interleaved threads is one situation. </p><p>Let's say this code is called from two threads and this is the order of events:</p><p>Thread A executes the <code>with-redefs</code></p><p>Thread B executes the <code>with-redefs</code></p><p>Thread A executes the body and exits the <code>with-redefs</code> block (thereby restoring the root binding of foo)</p><p>Thread B now executes the body and does not see the temp binding!!</p><p>The docs for <code>with-redefs</code> say this is handy for tests, which implies that if you want to change a var in non-test code, then <code>alter-var-root</code> (assuming it is done once, on startup) is the way to go. </p><p>However, there's nothing to stop you hitting an interleaving problem in tests unless you are running your tests serially and the with-redef wraps the test body. There isn't a <code>with-redefs-visible-only-via-this-block</code> or equivalent.</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>Use <code>with-redefs</code> cautiously. Remember this blog post when scratching your head about why some code is not seeing a temp binding.</p>
