  Revisiting &#39;Clojure Don&#39;ts : concat
  
</h1>
<h1 id="nostalgia&#95;city">Nostalgia city</h1><p>I've recently started maintaining a Clojure codebase that hasn't been touched for over a decade - all Clojure devs that built and maintained it are long gone. It's using java8, Clojure 1.6 and libs like korma and noir - remember those? Contrary to the prevailing Clojure lore, upgrading Clojure will not be just a matter of changing version numbers in the lein project.clj.</p><p>I find one of the most dated aspects of the project is the laziness. I only use laziness as an explicit choice and have done so for many years. Laziness is a feature I find I rarely need, but is sometimes just the right fit. </p><p>A lot of the original Clojure collection functions are lazy and it is still common to see new code written with them - I think because they are still seen as an idiomatic default, rather than a conscious choice. Non-lazy versions like <code>mapv</code> and <code>filterv</code> came later and transducers later still, but of course the old functions must continue to work as before.</p><p>Investigating a bug in the codebase led me back to this great blog post, <a href='https://stuartsierra.com/2015/04/26/clojure-donts-concat'>Clojure Dont's: Concat</a> also written around a decade ago. The rest of this post will discuss that post, so if you haven't please read that (and ofc the rest of the 'Dont's series is also good').</p><h1 id="revisiting&#95;the&#95;post">Revisiting the post</h1><p>I had first read the post many years ago and had forgotten the details - I guess, the main thing I remembered was 'don't use concat' - which is maybe a good heuristic but actually missed the main point which could be phrased as <code>build lazy sequences starting from the outside</code> - I'll explain the outside thing further on. </p><p>Reading it again, I had go over it couple of times to fully understand it - if it was crystal clear to you then you've no need to read on. To check your understanding - answer this: what difference would it make (wrt overflow) to change the order of the args to <code>concat</code>  in the <code>build-result</code> function?</p><p>Following is my attempt to make the post's message even clearer.</p><p>The post mentions that <code>seq</code> realises the collection and causes the overflow. Just in case it is not clear, <code>seq</code> does not in general realise lazy collections in entirety, it just realises the first element.</p><p>To demonstrate that, have a look at the following, which is like <code>range</code> but the numbers in the sequence descend to one :</p><pre><code class="lang-clojure language-clojure">
&#40;defn range-descending &#91;x&#93;
  &#40;when &#40;pos? x&#41;
    &#40;lazy-seq
      &#40;cons x &#40;range-descending &#40;dec x&#41;&#41;&#41;&#41;&#41;&#41;

&#40;let &#91;&#95; &#40;seq &#40;range-descending 4000&#41;&#41;&#93;
  nil&#41; ; =&gt; ok, no overflow

</code></pre><p>This is what one might call an <code>outside-in lazy sequence</code>. As the sequence is generated, one might picture it like this:</p><pre><code class="lang-clojure language-clojure">&#40;4000, `f`&#41;
&#40;4000, 3999, `f`&#41;
&#40;4000, 3999, 3998, `f`&#41;
...
</code></pre><p>Calling seq on the collection, only the first element is realized, so no overflow.</p><p>The equivalent to the way <code>concat</code> was used in the original post would be more like this:</p><pre><code class="lang-clojure language-clojure">  &#40;defn range-descending-ohno &#91;x&#93;
    &#40;when &#40;pos? x&#41;
      &#40;lazy-seq
        &#40;conj &#40;range-descending &#40;dec x&#41;&#41; x&#41;&#41;&#41;&#41;
</code></pre><p>Now visualising the sequence generation, it would look more like this:</p><pre><code class="lang-clojure language-clojure">&#40;`f`&#41; 
&#40;conj &#40;`f`&#41; 4000&#41;
&#40;conj &#40;conj &#40;`f`&#41; 3999&#41; 4000&#41;
...
&#40;conj `...` &#40;conj nil 1&#41; `...` 4000&#41;    
</code></pre><p>Now when calling <code>seq</code> (as in <code>&#40;seq &#40;range-descending-ohno 4000&#41;&#41;</code>), the whole sequence needs to be realised for <code>seq</code> to get to the first element (4000 in the example). As the post says: <code>seq has to recurse through them until it finds an actual value</code>. One might call this an <code>inside-out lazy sequence</code>. </p><h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>The original post concludes <code>Donâ€™t use lazy sequence operations in a non-lazy loop</code> - which I would update to add <code>don't use laziness at all unless required</code>.</p><p>If deciding to use laziness, avoid building sequences inside-out - this might be in your direct usage of e.g. <code>lazy-seq</code> or hiding in plain sight in your usage of e.g. clojure.core functions such as concat.</p>
