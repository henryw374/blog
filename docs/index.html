  Log data, not strings - with SLF4J
  
  </a>
  
</h1>
<p>A recent release of the popular Java logging abstraction SLF4J has a new API enabling <a href='https://stackify.com/what-is-structured-logging-and-why-developers-need-it/'>structured logging</a>. New Clojure logging macros using this, e.g. <code>&#40;log/info &quot;request-for-help&quot; {&quot;priority&quot; &quot;high&quot;}&#41;</code> are available as <a href='https://github.com/henryw374/slf4clj'>slf4clj</a>.</p><h1>Why Log data?</h1><p>A couple of years ago I made a survey of all the logging libraries one might use from Clojure. The majority of contenders (<a href='https://github.com/clojure/tools.logging'>clojure.tools.logging</a> foremost among them) I ruled out fairly early because they only log strings, not data.</p><p>To explain this limitation, in all logging frameworks you can format messages as json or something and get <code>{level: &quot;INFO&quot;, message &quot;Commissioner Gordon called because Gotham city is under attack from the Joker&quot;}</code>. Whilst useful, what is more queryable is to log arbitrary data (key value pairs) and have that data passed as-is to appenders, which might serialise to json, or write to a database. An equivalent message formatted as JSON might be <code>{level: &quot;INFO&quot;, message-type: &quot;request for help&quot;, urgency: &quot;high&quot;, caller: &quot;Commissioner Gordon&quot;, foe: &quot;Joker&quot;, target:&quot;Gotham&quot; }</code>. Assuming you're not still shelling into boxes and grepping log files, IMO <a href='https://stackify.com/what-is-structured-logging-and-why-developers-need-it/'>structured log data</a> is something you can't go back from.</p><h1>Options for Logging data from Clojure</h1><p>The requirement to log data left two main contenders, <a href='https://github.com/BrunoBonacci/mulog'>MuLog</a> and <a href='https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/'>Log4j2</a>. At the time I decided Log4j2 seemed like  the boring, safe choice. Well, that didn't turn out to be quite right haha! </p><p>As a result of opting for Log4j2, I put some <a href='https://github.com/henryw374/clojure.log4j2'>helper functions in a lib</a> for Clojure users writing log statements against Log4j2. Note: the <a href='https://github.com/henryw374/clojure.log4j2'>README</a> for those contains more detailed comparison of existing Clojure logging libraries.</p><p>Released since I made that review, and created as a result of log4shell is <a href='https://github.com/amperity/dialog'>Amperity's Dialog</a> which is a logging backend for <a href='https://www.slf4j.org/'>slf4j</a>(1.x, string based) - the de facto Java logging facade. Dialog also provides a <a href='https://github.com/amperity/dialog/blob/main/src/clojure/dialog/logger.clj'>Logging API based on logging strings</a> or suggests you use clojure.tools.logging (strings again).</p><h1>Logging from Library Code</h1><p>Log4j2 is a 'logging implementation' or 'backend'. Ideally one would write log statements against a logging abstraction, where log statements get channeled to whatever logging backend is in place. This is especially important when writing library code. Users of e.g. <a href='https://github.com/ptaoussanis/carmine'>Carmine</a> users will find logs coming via Timbre whether they like it or not. </p><p>Looking at the options here, assuming we want to log data ofc, MuLog might be a choice. It has be made to plug into an <a href='https://gitlab.com/nonseldiha/slf4j-mulog'>slf4j 1.x backend</a>, so surely can be made to plug into other things.</p><p>The most obvious choice though is <a href='https://www.slf4j.org/'>SLF4J</a>, apparently <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLF4J'>the most popular Java library of any kind</a>. The 1.x version of this has been around for a long time and as you'd expect from an API dating from the noughties it only logs strings. With the 2.0 release, that has changed.</p><h1>Logging data with Slf4j</h1><p>Enter slf4j 2.0 - which was released toward the end of 2022. The 2.0 version of this popular logging facade has newly includes an <a href='https://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#fluent'>API for logging data</a>, whilst remaining backwards compatible with the 1.x API.</p><p>The fluent API contains the <code>addKeyValue&#40;String key, Object value&#41;</code> method for structured logging. It's up to implementations as to what to do with the structured data. They may merge it to the <a href='https://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/MDC.html'>MDC</a> for that message for example as Log4j2-slf4j bridge does. The MDC is a map of String->String though, which is a problem if the value happens to be anything other than a string.</p><p>It is straightforward to use from Clojure as-is, but there are some convenience macros released as a new library <a href='https://github.com/henryw374/slf4clj'>slf4clj</a>. The aim is not to re-create the whole API, just offer some shorthand for the majority of use cases.</p><p>As you'd expect there are macros for <code>debug</code>, <code>info</code>, <code>warn</code> etc and the args for each are deliberately the same as Clojure's <a href='https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/ex-info'>ex-info</a>, namely  <code>&#40;&lt;level&gt; msg map&#41;</code> or <code>&#40;&lt;level&gt; msg map cause&#41;</code>.</p><p>Here is an example:</p><pre><code class="lang-clojure">&#40;require '&#91;com.widdindustries.slf4clj.core :as log&#93;&#41;

&#40;log/info &quot;request-for-help&quot; {&quot;urgency&quot; &quot;high&quot;, &quot;caller&quot; &quot;Commissioner Gordon&quot;, &quot;foe&quot; &quot;Joker&quot;, &quot;target&quot; &quot;Gotham&quot;}&#41;
</code></pre><h2>Migration path</h2><p>If you're using clojure.tools.logging, you can keep your existing setup and just start writing slj4j 2.0 logging statements and that will likely 'just work' in that the data will get printed out in some string format according to your pattern config). Separately you can change your logging backend to  something that does more with structured logs than just turning them into strings, like writing them as JSON for example.</p><h1>Logging APIs bundled with the JVM</h1><p>If you're logging from a library it is possible to avoid having any logging dependency by using APIs included with the jvm.</p><p>java.util.logging (JUL) is the one you have most likely heard of. As you might guess though for something created in the early part of this century, it is a string-based logging API. <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11359187/why-not-use-java-util-logging'>This question on Stackoverflow</a> goes into some details about JUL but in the threads is mention of a newer platform Logging facade called <a href='https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.Logger.html'>System.Logger</a> - which might be interesting but doesn't seem to have gained traction AFAICT.</p><h1>Unrelated FYI</h1><p>This is my first blog post since moving to <a href='https://github.com/borkdude/quickblog'>Quickblog</a> - a blogging tool powered by Clojure - thanks Borkdude!</p>

  <a href="clojurescript-jar-embeds-other-libs.html">
  
  Clojurescript jar embeds some core libraries
  
  </a>
  
</h1>
<p><em>Update:</em> As of mid-2022, Clojurescript has fixed the problems described in this post.</p><p>Why having clojurescript in the classpath may lead to unexpected behaviour</p><p>The <a href='https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.clojure/clojurescript/1.11.4'>clojurescript maven artifact</a>  lists compile dependencies which include: data.json, tools.reader and transit-clj and transit-java. </p><p>However the clojurescript jar itself is something like an uberjar: It includes compiled data.json, tools.reader and transit-clj and transit-java namespaces inside itself. That means that although it declares dependencies on those libraries, when you use Clojurescript yourself, those libraries' artifacts are not used at all (despite being on your disk and in the classpath). </p><p>The output of this command shows the dependencies I am referring to:</p><pre><code>clj -Sdeps '{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version &quot;1.11.4&quot; } }}' -Stree
</code></pre><p>The effect is that if you want to use a different version of one of those libraries  compared to the one Clojurescript was compiled with, you can't. Well, you can't with the regular clojurescript artifact, you can use the non-aot version: <code>org.clojure/clojurescript$slim {:mvn/version “1.11.4”}</code>.</p><p>This was not an issue for a long time because those libraries didn't change. Now e.g. clojure.data.json has changed, hence why I hit the problem. </p><p>A handy technique I usually use to answer the question 'where on the classpath is namespace x.y.z getting loaded  from?' is to call <code>io/resource</code> on it. Doing that with data.json and Clojurescript in the classpath  gives result as follows: </p><pre><code class="lang-clojure"> &#40;clojure.java.io/resource &quot;clojure/data/json.clj&quot;&#41;
 
 =&gt; &quot;.../.m2/repository/org/clojure/data.json/2.4.0/data.json-2.4.0.jar!/clojure/data/json.clj&quot;&#93;
</code></pre><p>which is the wrong answer! I still don't understand why io/resource shows the file there, whereas calling <code>require</code> on that ns returns the one embedded in Clojurescript.</p><p>One might ask why I would be using Clojurescript and clojure.data.json together in the same jvm.  Well, in my case, in development I tend to have my server and client dependencies combined, so  I run cljs compile and server side stuff in one vm. When deploying and testing, I separate them  (meaning Clojurescript jar is only on the classpath when cljs source is being compiled). It is possible to run separate server and cljs jvm's  locally of course, but that then means I can't have a single .nrepl.edn file for example. There could be  other reasons for using these 2 together though, writing data-reader functions that use json possibly.<br /></p><p>I raised this on clojure slack and now Clojurescript's maintainers are aware, so hopefully this gets fixed. </p><p>A fix is likely to involve <code>shading</code>. This is where a library wants to use a fixed version  of another library, so it copies the sources of that library into itself, but changes  the namespaces/packages of the source library to be something different, and specific to itself.</p><p>My thanks go to Alex Miller for explaining this.<br />  </p>

<h1>
  
  <a href="async-meet-laziness.html">
  
  you Promise to be Lazy?
  
  </a>
  
</h1>
<p>Combining Java's promises with Clojure's laziness yields some interesting behaviour</p><p>Consider:</p><pre><code class="lang-clojure">
&#40;doseq &#91;x &#40;range 1000000&#41;&#93;&#41;

</code></pre><p>Since <code>range</code> returns a lazy sequence and <code>doseq</code> does not retain the head of the sequence, there will only be one element of the sequence realized at every step of the <code>doseq</code>.</p><p>Now let's split the creation and consumption of the lazy sequence over chained promises.  I am using <a href='https://github.com/funcool/promesa'>the promesa library</a>, which on the jvm is a thin wrapper over java.util.concurrent#CompletableFuture.</p><pre><code class="lang-clojure">
&#40;-&gt; &#40;p/resolved &#40;range 1000000&#41;&#41;
    &#40;p/then &#40;fn &#91;xs&#93;
              &#40;doseq &#91;x xs&#93;&#41;&#41;&#41;&#41;

</code></pre><p>It looks like it should be just as lazy. Nowhere is the code above retaining a reference to  the head of the sequence - and yet it is! </p><p>The <code>then</code> promise internally has a reference to the preceding promise and that promise has a reference to its result - the head of the sequence. When the first promise returns, the sequence is unrealized, but as the subsequent <code>then</code> promise consumes the sequence it is realized and the head retained  by the preceding promise!</p><p>What happens if there is a longer chain of promises? A promise executing in a chain only has reference to the preceding one. The preceding one has lost its reference to the  next one upstream of itself, so in a chain just the current and immediately preceding one are not  gc-able. </p><p>So? Well imagine you are streaming results out of a db for example - that might be  modelled as a lazy seq, which is consumed through e.g. doseq and written out to a  stream. Sounds like a nice memory-friendly solution, but if the db request results in a  promise it might seem natural to keep chaining that result on. </p><h1>Further thoughts</h1><p>Does this apply to </p><ul><li>js promises? I would imagine so</li><li>core.async channels? I would guess not</li></ul><p>I haven't investigated.</p><p>Related to this topic is <a href='https://stuartsierra.com/2015/08/25/clojure-donts-lazy-effects'>Stuart Sierra's Lazy Effects</a> post, in which he says never mix laziness and side-effects. Good advice I would say.</p>
