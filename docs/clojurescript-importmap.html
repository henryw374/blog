  Clojurescript using JS libraries via importmap
  
</h1>
<p>In this post I am going to look at using the <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap'>importmap</a> feature (supported by all modern browsers), as an alternative way for Clojurescript apps to access npm dependencies.</p><h1>The Problem</h1><p>When a Clojurescript app depends on a regular JS library, such as React for example, then it is typical to:</p><ul><li>have the code from the npm library 'processed' in some fashion (e.g. to target a specific JS version)</li><li>bundle the 3rd party code with the application code and have it delivered from the application server</li></ul><p>There are different ways this can happen, for example:</p><ul><li>use <code>:target :bundle</code> with <a href='https://clojurescript.org/guides/webpack'>a bundler such as webpack</a></li><li>use shadow-cljs with its default <a href='https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#js-provider'>shadow provider</a></li></ul><p>I am a fan of shadow-cljs and so would typically use the second option. What this actually does is <code>:simple</code> optimizations on 3rd-party code, which means Google Closure code is going to read 3rd-party libs when the app is being built. Sometimes though, Closure cannot understand the 3rd party code, for example because <a href='https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/issues/2731'>it doesnt have support for Class fields</a>. According to this really interesting <a href='https://youtu.be/fT28NeZtaAg?si=1Tbxw3NMk3Cmy_aO&t=1194'>talk from Alex Davis</a>, he is seeing more and more popular JS libraries that Closure can't handle. I've only had the issue once myself and thankfully was able to configure shadow to use a different file than the problem one.</p><p>So, what to do?</p><h1>Using importmap</h1><p>Sticking with shadow but using it with a different provider (e.g. webpack) is an option, but for browser apps there is another interesting option to consider: get pre-processed 3rd party libraries directly in the browser via a <code>script</code> tag (e.g. from a CDN such as unpkg).</p><p>I used a version of this approach for my <a href='https://widdindustries.com/blog/clojurescript-datetime-lib-comparison.html'>experiments that called the deja-fu library's rationale into question</a>. There, I just had a couple of script tags for 3rd party libs, followed by a script tag getting the application code. This meant script tags were order-sensitive and would not scale well because transitive dependencies would not be fetched automatically. Still, for a simple app it worked fine.</p><p>Recently though, all browsers have got support for <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap'>importmap</a>, which is best explained by example:</p><pre><code class="lang-html">
&lt;script type=&quot;importmap&quot;&gt;
{
  &quot;imports&quot;: {
    &quot;react&quot;: &quot;https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0&quot;,
    &quot;react-dom/client&quot;: &quot;https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0&quot;,
     &quot;@tanstack/react-router&quot;: &quot;https://esm.sh/@tanstack/react-router&quot;,
     &quot;my-demo-app&quot;: &quot;/cljs-importmap-demo/cljs-out/main.js&quot;
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script  type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;
    import start from &quot;my-demo-app&quot;;
    start&#40;&#41;;
&lt;/script&gt;

</code></pre><p>The <code>imports</code> map is a bit like package.json dependencies - it says what libraries are needed and details of how to get them - all must arrive as ES6 modules. Transitive dependencies are also retrieved. After the importmap, the script tag with <code>type=module</code> says to interpret the code within as an ES6 module. Here, it just imports the application code and starts it.</p><p>The module <code>my-demo-app</code> just contains the application code, not any 3rd party libraries. To generate the module from clojuresript code is just a matter of using Shadow-cljs documented options for that, for example:</p><pre><code class="lang-clojure">{:target     :esm
 :js-options {:js-provider :import}
 :modules    {:main {:exports {'default 'com.widdindustries.demo-app.app/init}}}}
</code></pre><p>Here is <a href='https://widdindustries.com/cljs-importmap-demo'>an example app demonstrating this technique</a> and here is <a href='https://github.com/henryw374/cljs-importmap-demo'>the source code</a> for that.</p><h1>Pros and cons</h1><p>This is the first time I've tried using importmap. I failed to google any experience reports of anyone using it from Clojurescript, hence this post. Here are some pros and cons I am aware of so far:</p><p>Using importmap, 3rd party libraries can be cached. The application code will also be cached, but is likely to change at a faster rate than library versions get changed, so will be downloaded more frequently, but will be smaller than the tradition bundled version.</p><p>The importmap is specified in the html file, but will also need to be specified again for a page that loads tests for example. Also, it may be required to use a dev-time version of a library locally, but deploy with the optimized one. For example, React performance profiling tools only work with the dev-time React version. It is possible to conditionally create the importmap, for example, if on localhost, create one map, if deployed a different one.</p><p>The 3rd party libraries are being retrieved wholesale - ie no dead code elimination could happen here. Is significant dead code elimination a thing in JS-land these days though? I've heard of Rollup, but I haven't tried out how it would help trim down React and the like.</p><p>importmap is a relatively recent addition to browsers - so might not be suitable for some potential users.</p><p>Loading speed vs bundled apps, aka time-to-interactive (TTI)? I haven't measured anything yet. Please comment if you have experience of this.</p><p>Any more you'd add? Please use the link below to discuss. </p>
