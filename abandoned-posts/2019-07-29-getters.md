We have some data:

```
{:name "Joe Bloggs"}
```

Do we need a getter?

```
(defn get-name [person]
  (:name person))
```

Doesn't add much value. 

What about information hiding? I can still access the `:name` attribute so why bother?

With Clojure datastructures and records you can always access the data directly. That's intentional,
since the majority of the core lib is providing fns for working with data. 

What might well add value is namespacing the attributes...

More complex example:

```
{:name "Joe bloggs"
 :addresses #{{:id "4jsk5sllkssrt"
               :line1 "52 Acacia Rd"
               :city "Gotham"}
               {:id "4s8sdf8sos....
                 ...}}
 :billing-address "4jsk5sllkssrt" 
}
                 
```

We want to post this person a bill. 

In order to do that, it looks like we'll need to do a couple of look-ups on the map, first to get
the billing-address id and then find the actual address from that. 

Now I start seeing some value in a getter.

```
(defn billing-address [person]
  ...)
```
