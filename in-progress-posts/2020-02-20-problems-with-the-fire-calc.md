title: Problems with the FIRE calc

I'm quite new to the whole FIRE thing and it seems like the obvious first question is 'when can I retire?' and to 
help answer that I've found this calculator: https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement which comes with some
accompanying blog posts about why that particular calculation have come about.

The article states that the math behind FIRE is 'shockingly simple', but from my own perspective it looks as if it might be too simple. 
The following are some complexitities not accounted for by the calculation:

Changes in spending over time: I have children and a mortgage. Once the children leave home and the house is paid off, I expect to have
considerably lower spending.  

Changes in earning: what if I hope to get promoted a few times? That would change the ratio over time

Taxes: I live in the UK and the tax incentives around income, investments, pensions and so on are complex. Again, they don't come into the calc. Of course, 
the system changes all the time but you could assume it'll remain similar to how it is now. 

Other income: In the UK there is a 'state pension', a regular cash payment you receive once you reach a certain age. Again, possibly this will change

Never drawing down capital: This seems more sensible the younger you are, but at my age it doesn't look so sensible. I'm no spring chicken and I won't live forever.

So overall, the FIRE calc makes sense in the abstract, but I think it needs some changes to make it applicable to me personally.
